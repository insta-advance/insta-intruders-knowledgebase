# Pentesting a network

## Capturing packet data

When penetration testing an network, it might be helpful to capture packets moving around on the network.

### Tools

#### Wireshark

Helpful for listening for packet data on the network. Can be used to capture data and inspect it. Captured data can be stored to PCAP files for further analysis.

### Useful resources

Challenges for practice etc. here

## Intercepting traffic

When we want to attack other hosts on the network, man-in-the-middle attacks can be very helpful. 

### ARP Spoofing

ARP Spoofing is an attack where spoofed ARP packets are sent to devices on the network in order to pass their data through an attacker machine.

#### Tools

##### arpspoof

arpspoof is an simple command-line tool for intercepting traffic.
